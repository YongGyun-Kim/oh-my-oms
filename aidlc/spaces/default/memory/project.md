# Project-Level Rules

> Project-specific specialisation and corrections. Loaded after `org.md` and
> `team.md` as strict-additive guidance; contradictions with broader policy
> are rejected. Populated by practices-discovery and the self-learning loop.
>
> Use sparingly: most teams don't need a project layer. Reach for it
> only when this specific project needs stable, durable guidance beyond the
> team practice (for example, package-specific release checks or an additional
> regression suite for a legacy component).

## Way of Working

<!-- Project-specific specialisation. Example: -->
<!-- This monorepo requires package-scoped branch names and a package owner -->
<!-- review in addition to the team's normal merge policy. -->

## Walking Skeleton

<!-- Project-specific specialisation. Example: -->
<!-- The walking skeleton must exercise the legacy service adapter as well -->
<!-- as the new service boundary. -->

## Testing Posture

<!-- Project-specific specialisation. -->

## Guard Policy

<!-- Project-specific. Mode: strict, relaxed, or off. Strict here holds for every intent and cannot be changed from chat. A section under the retired Change Control heading, written by an earlier release, is still read. -->

## Deployment

<!-- Project-specific specialisation. -->

## Code Style

<!-- Project-specific specialisation. -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- Technology choices locked for this project. -->

## Decided

<!-- Decisions made in earlier stages that should not be re-asked. -->
<!-- Format: DECIDED: [decision] (Stage [slug], [date]) -->

## Scope Overrides

<!-- Custom scope rules for this project. -->

## Forbidden

<!-- Populated by practices-discovery affirmation gate. -->
<!-- Format: NEVER [behavior] (affirmed [date]) -->
<!-- Example: NEVER throw exceptions across service layer boundaries (affirmed 2026-05-17) -->

## Mandated

<!-- Populated by practices-discovery affirmation gate. -->
<!-- Format: ALWAYS [behavior] (affirmed [date]) -->
<!-- Example: ALWAYS use Result<T,E> for fallible operations in service layer (affirmed 2026-05-17) -->

## Corrections

<!-- Project-specific corrections from human feedback. -->
<!-- Format: NEVER/ALWAYS [behavior] (learned [date]) -->
- 개발자 1명은 현재 인력 현황이며 기능 범위를 제한하는 제약으로 사용하지 않는다. 필요한 기능 개발과 운영을 1명이 충분히 수행할 수 있는 구조를 설계 목표로 삼는다. 인원 수를 이유로 필요한 기능을 자동 축소하지 않으며, 후속 설계·구현에서 개발·운영 부담과 목표 달성 여부를 검증한다. (learned 2026-10-04) <!-- cid:261004-feature:feasibility:c4c36ca8f93ed7cb84f9ce41501469f7d39feb7888c10a92c922a78587507597 -->
